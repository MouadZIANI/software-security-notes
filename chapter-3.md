## Chapter 3: Authentication & Authorization

Access control is one of the constance of computer security, access controle there's physical and logical access control, in general acces controle contains 2 basics concepts, authentication and authorization and optionaly accounting (AAA)

#### I.1 Authentication: 
 - Identity It's the process of verification of user system identity
 - They are 3 Authentication factors
   + Knowledge based factors by another hands **what you know ?**
   + Position based **what you have ?** (ex: student card ..)
   + Biometric based **what you're ?** we can also consider location 
   - Theses authentications factors can be used in 3 ways 
     + Single Authentication Factor (**SF**)
     + Two factors authentications (**2FA**)
     + Multi-Factors authentications (**MFA**)
     + Theses 2 above Factors are used ~~~~in Strong Authentication
 - Strong Authentication is usually confused with 2FA or MFA, but is not necessarily that
   + For example (Cryptography based) can consider as strong authentication like Zero knowledge authentication (Ex: **Kerberos**)
